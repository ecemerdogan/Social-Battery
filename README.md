# Social-Battery
Social Battery project is a web-based development that lets the users sign up to the website and create a personalized profile, and created by Ecem Erdoğan and Sinem Altun within the scope of a lecture named "Programming Algorithms" in Istanbul Technical University. What makes the users profile unique, is the survey they fill out at the beginning which based on the answers, aims to categorize people by their sociality level and event preferences. The result of this survey is kept in data sheets and play an important role. After the sign up and survey processes the application starts to suggest events (such as concerts, book club meetings, taking a walk etc. These events are also reached by MySQL) based on how the user was categorized previously by their answers and the weather data that is pulled.

The coding process will be completed in 3 main parts:

- The design of the GUI will be done using HTML, CSS, jQuery.(This process can be done with Java as well.)

- Web services between database and GUI will be developed thanks to RESTful API with Java. Several web requests will be sent when the user activity starts such as logging in, taking the survey.
  
- All data tables will be kept and pulled using MySQL and JDBC.

This project is aimed to:

- Increase user’s sociality with suggested activities based on personalized data and weather conditions of that day,

- Avoid wasting time searching for the proper event for you in the different million websites,

- Improve yourself in numerous fields even though intense work/school pressure. To sum up, our project’s goal is to help people by filtering numerous different data to suggest the best event based on his/her interests and needs which are detected from test results the user has filled in before. This will be a website where people charge their social battery!
